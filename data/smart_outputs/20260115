 **1️⃣ New‑Asset Recommendations (Kraken / EUR pairs – not already in your portfolio)**  

| # | Asset (EUR pair) | Why it’s attractive (2026 outlook) | Recommended Allocation* |
|---|------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | **MATIC/EUR** (Polygon) | Strong layer‑2 adoption, fast cheap txs, ecosystem growth (DeFi, NFTs). Market cap ~ €12 bn, price still ~ 30 % below 2024‑2025 highs – bullish technicals (price > 20‑day MA, RSI 45). | 2 % of total equity |
| 2 | **DOT/EUR** (Polkadot) | Multi‑chain interoperability, parachain auctions filling, staking yields ≈ 12 % APR. Price has formed a steady up‑trend channel after a 2024 correction. | 2 % |
| 3 | **XMR/EUR** (Monero) | Privacy‑coin demand resurging after regulatory clarity in EU (2025 “privacy‑friendly” framework). Volume on Kraken is high, price above 50‑day MA. | 1 % |
| 4 | **DOGE/EUR** (Dogecoin) | Continues to be the “retail meme” coin with strong community & merchant acceptance. Recent technicals show a bullish MACD crossover and RSI 38 (near‑oversold). | 1 % |
| 5 | **CRO/EUR** (Cronos) | Crypto.com ecosystem expanding (payment cards, DeFi). CRO has been consolidating above its 20‑day MA with rising on‑chain activity. | 1 % |
| 6 | **NEAR/EUR** (NEAR Protocol) | Fast sharding design, growing DeFi & gaming projects. Volume on Kraken has risen 45 % YoY, price breaking above recent resistance. | 1 % |
| 7 | **GRT/EUR** (The Graph) | Indexing layer for Web3; usage metrics (queries) up 30 % YoY. Price is in a lower‑half channel but RSI 28 suggests oversold – upside potential. | 0.5 % |
| 8 | **CRV/EUR** (Curve) | Dominant stable‑coin AMM, fee revenue rising with DeFi TVL. Technicals: price just crossed 20‑day MA, MACD turning positive. | 0.5 % |
| 9 | **APT/EUR** (Aptos) | High‑throughput L1 with several enterprise pilots announced in 2025. Market sentiment improving; price forming higher lows. | 0.5 % |
|10| **KSM/EUR** (Kusama) | “Canary” network for Polkadot; often leads DOT moves. Recent rally (+22 % in 4 weeks) with strong volume. | 0.5 % |

\*Allocation is suggested **relative to your total portfolio value** (≈ €31 k). Adjust according to your risk tolerance.
