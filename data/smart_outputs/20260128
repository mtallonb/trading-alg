| **XLMEUR** (Stellar) | 20‑day MA broken, RSI ≈ 25, low volume – likely to stay sideways. |
| **SNXEUR** (Synthetix) | Bearish MACD, RSI ≈ 22, decreasing staking rewards, market cap erosion. |

| **FLOWEUR** (Flow) | Declining NFT usage, MACD negative, RSI ≈ 30, volume down 60 % YoY. |
| **FETEUR** (Fetch.ai) | Technical death cross, RSI ≈ 28, fundamentals lagging behind AI‑token peers. |
| **FILEUR** (Filecoin) | Price below 200‑day MA, MACD negative, storage‑price competition hurting margins. |
| **DOTEUR** (Polkadot) | MACD negative, RSI ≈ 27, upcoming parachain auction may be oversubscribed, but price pressure remains. |
| **APTEUR** (Aptos) | Bearish trend, RSI ≈ 25, low liquidity on EUR pair. |
| **AVAXEUR** (Avalanche) – *you already own AVAX via the new recommendation* – sell current AVAX exposure. |
| **ETCEUR** (Ethereum Classic) | Persistent hash‑rate decline, MACD negative, RSI ≈ 23. |
| **SCEUR** (Secret) | Near‑zero volume, price under 20‑day MA, project funding drying up. |

**How to read the table**

* **Score/10** – Overall conviction (technical + fundamental).  
* **MA (0‑3)** – 3 = price > both 20‑day & 50‑day moving averages, 2 = above one, 0 = below both.  
* **RSI (0‑3)** – 3 = 30‑70 (neutral), 2 = < 35 (oversold – potential upside), 1 = > 65 (overbought).  
* **MACD (0‑2)** – 2 = bullish crossover, 1 = flat, 0 = bearish.  
* **Vol (0‑2)** – 2 = > average 30‑day EUR‑pair volume, 1 = average, 0 = low.  

Assets marked **“*sell*”** are the ones you should exit **completely** (see section 2). All others are **hold**; you may consider modestly increasing positions in the top‑scoring assets (BTC, ETH, SOL, AAVE, BNB) or reallocating the proceeds into the **new recommendations** listed in section 1.

---

**Next steps**

1. **Liquidate** the under‑performing assets listed in section 2.  
2. **Re‑balance** the freed capital into the high‑score holdings (BTC, ETH, SOL, AAVE, BNB) and the six new assets (MATIC, XMR, KSM, ICP, CRO, GALA).  
3. **Review** the portfolio monthly – update the technical scores and adjust allocations if any asset’s MA/RSI/MACD signals change dramatically.  

*All numbers are based on publicly‑available market data as of 28 Jan 2026 and reflect a medium‑term (6‑12 month) outlook.*
